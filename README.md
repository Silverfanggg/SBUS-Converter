# SBUS-CONVERTER
It is a system that converts the signal you send as UART to SBUS. I designed it for use in drones. It allows you to manipulate the data from the controller and command the flight control card via UART protocol from a PC. Flight control cards that use SBUS protocol and are closed source can thus become autonomous.
